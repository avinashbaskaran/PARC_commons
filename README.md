# PARC (Personal Staging)

This is my <u>personal</u> staging space for the **[Precision Agronomy Research Center (PARC)](parccommons.org)**.  

This space is for drafting ideas, prototyping tools, and exploring concepts before they are ready for the [PARC GitHub page](https://github.com/parc).

## What is PARC?

The **[Precision Agronomy Research Center (PARC)](parccommons.org)** is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to leading scientific discovery into:

- Agriculture 
- Energy Production
- Ecological Management
for *robust* and *independent* communities  

PARC operates a 40-acre community farm and research center in rural Alabama, and works with local producers, researchers, and open-source collaborators to strengthen  
regional self-sufficiency.

For official resources, visit the [PARC organization](https://github.com/parc).

## What’s in this repo?

This repo serves as a *lab notebook and sandbox*. You’ll find:

- `/docs/`: Draft charters, governance models, onboarding notes  
- `/research/`: Early protocols and exploratory ideas in soil, food, and energy systems  
- `/notebooks/`: Computational experiments and prototypes  
- `/experiments/`: Code sketches and robotics/automation testbeds  
- `/community/`: Notes on membership, workshops, partnerships  
- `/media/`: Diagrams, sketches, and concept layouts  
- `/archive/`: Old drafts and abandoned directions kept for reference  

Nothing here should be considered final. Stable outputs are migrated into the official PARC org repos.
